# What is Cloud Computing? 

NIST - Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

- Easily available computing resources accessed through the internet using a large cloud provider 

## What is happening? 

1) Servers hosted in AWS Data centre
2) Rent parts of servers 
3) Use SSH to access rented computers
4) Use those rented computers to do everything!

## Features

### On Demand Self Service 
Cloud resources are provisioned by the user (self service) whenever they require through an on demand gui

### Consumption pricing
Pay for the amount of resources used, not for the start up cost of servers when you're not using them

### Resource Pooling
You are a tenant working on a shared server with other tenants. Constantly being reassigned for efficiency

### Rapid Elasticity
Elasticty = Use *exactly* the resources you need
Vertical Scaling - More resources to your instance (more ram etc)
Horizontal Scaling - More instances to your 'cluster'

### Fault Tolerance
Ability for your application to persist if any/one layer fails
AutoScaling - scales depending on usage
Makes application more resilient

### Economies of Scale
larger componies (amazon) can lower cost per unit with greater numbers
Cheaper for Amazon, cheaper for you
