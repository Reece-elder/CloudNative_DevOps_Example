## Regions and AV Zones

Data centres located in specific geographic locations, regions are the areas that house the datacentres
Some locations have multiple datacentres, split by letters

Region Name: Location: Region Identifier

EU: Ireland: eu-west-1

US East: Northern Virginia: us-east-1


Every resource you create will be tied to that region (STICK TO THE SAME REGION) 
Different regions have different resources (USE IRELAND, MOST RELIABLE)

## Availability Zones

Regions can be broken down more (A, B, C), used so that if one location goes down (power, malfunction) your data is safe
Certain resources require more or less geo flexibility
