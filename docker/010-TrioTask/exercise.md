In Groups doing peer coding do the Trio Task exercise.

Things to remember:

1) Make sure you don't have any other containers running at the same time to confuse the networ
2) Look up the MySQL Docs to see HOW TO DO IT
3) Use MySQL 5.7
4) You don't need to use a Dockerfile to create a new MySQL image (but you can)
5) Create an nginx.conf and use that for your dockerfile
6) If you're not sure how to modify something, install it locally OR docker exec into the container
